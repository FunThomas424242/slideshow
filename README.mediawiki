Eclipse Slideshow is an experiment in presentation simplicity. It separates content generation from presentation. As a content producer, you provide content in a wiki format; Slideshow uses that content to generate the best slides it can muster. It automatically positions graphics based on dimensions and makes text and other elements fit in the space provided.

You edit the content using MediaWiki format (the same format that we use on Eclipsepedia) and it renders in a view. As shown in the demo below, you can present full screen by clicking a button on the view. While intended as a demo, Slideshow has been used for real presentations at Eclipse Summit Europe, and other events.
